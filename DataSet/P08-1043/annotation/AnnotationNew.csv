1,P08-1043,2008,2,P11-1141,0,0,Goldberg and Tsarfaty (2008) showed that a single model for morphological segmentation and syntactic parsing of Hebrew yielded an error reduction of 12% over the best pipelined models,[19],Here we push the single-framework conjecture across the board and present a single model that performs morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation in a fully generative framework.,Method_Citation
2,P08-1043,2008,3,P10-1074,0,0,"Zhang and Clark (2008) built a perceptron-based joint segmenter and part-of-speech (POS) tagger for Chinese, and Toutanova and Cherry (2009) learned a joint model of lemmatization and POS tagging which outperformed a pipelined model. Adler and Elhadad (2006) presented an HMMbased approach for unsupervised joint morphological segmentation and tagging of Hebrew, and Goldberg and Tsarfaty (2008) developed a joint model of segmentation, tagging and parsing of He brew, based on lattice parsing",[3],Here we propose a single joint model for performing both morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation which bypasses the associated circularity.,Method_Citation
