0,E03-1005,"Bod, 2003",2,N06-1045,0,0,"Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP)? s methodology is to calculate weighted derivations, but as noted in (Bod, 2003), it is the highest ranking parse, not derivation, that is desired",[29],"Johnson (1998b, 2002) showed that DOP1's subtree estimation method is statistically biased and inconsistent.",Method_Citation
1,E03-1005,2003,3,D07-1058,0,0,"Goodman? s transform, in com bi nation with a range of heuristics, allowed Bod (2003) to run the DOP model on the Penn Treebank WSJ benchmark and obtain some of the best results obtained with a generative model",[34],"But even with cross-validation, ML-DOP is outperformed by the much simpler DOP1 model on both the ATIS and OVIS treebanks (Bod 2000b).",Method_Citation
2,E03-1005,"Bod, 2003",4,D07-1058,0,0,"Zuidema (2006a) shows that also the estimator (Bod, 2003) uses is biased and inconsistent, and will, even in the limit of infinite data, not correctly identify many possible distributions over trees",[76],Note that Goodman's reduction method does still not allow for an efficient computation of the most probable parse tree of a sentence: there may still be exponentially many derivations generating the same tree.,Method_Citation
3,E03-1005,"Bod, 2003",5,P11-1086,0,0,"Second, we compare against a composed-rule system, which is analogous to the Data Oriented Parsing (DOP) approach in parsing (Bod, 2003)",[126],"We focused on the Labeled Precision (LP) and Labeled Recall (LR) scores, as these are commonly used to rank parsing systems.",Method_Citation
4,E03-1005,"Bod, 2003",6,P04-1013,0,0,"Our best performing model is more accurate than all these previous models except (Bod, 2003)",[6],"To appreciate these innovations, it should be noted that the model was radically different from all other statistical parsing models at the time.",Method_Citation
5,E03-1005,"Bod, 2003",7,P04-1013,0,0,"We find that the discriminative probability model is much worse than the generative one, but that training to optimize the discriminative criteria results in improved performance. Performance of the latter model on the standard test set achieves 90.1% F-measure on constituents, which is the second best current ac curacy level, and only 0.6% below the current best (Bod, 2003) .This paper has also proposed a neural network training method which optimizes a discriminative criteria even when the parameters being estimated are those of a generative probability model",[107],This suggests that a model which combines these two notions of best parse may boost the accuracy.,Method_Citation
6,E03-1005,"Bod, 2003",10,E06-2025,0,0,"Similarly, (Bod, 2003) changes the way frequenciesfi are counted, with a similar effect",[14],"This innovation has not become generally adopted yet: many approaches still work either with local trees, i.e. single level rules with limited means of information percolation, or with restricted fragments, as in Stochastic Tree-Adjoining Grammar (Schabes 1992; Chiang 2000) that do not include nonlexicalized fragments.",Method_Citation

My approach is closely related to work in statistical parsing known as Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP), an empirically highly successful approach with labeled recall and precision scores on the Penn Tree Bank that are among the best currently obtained (Bod, 2003)",[14],"This innovation has not become generally adopted yet: many approaches still work either with local trees, i.e. single level rules with limited means of information percolation, or with restricted fragments, as in Stochastic Tree-Adjoining Grammar (Schabes 1992; Chiang 2000) that do not include nonlexicalized fragments.",Method_Citation
8,E03-1005,"Bod, 2003",13,W06-2905,0,0,"Shown are results were only elementary trees with scores higher than 0.3 and 0.1 respectively are used. However, more interesting is a qualitative analysis of the STSG induced, which shows that ,un like DOP1, push-n-pull arrives at a grammar that gives high weights (and scores) to those elementary3We approximated the most probable parse as follows (fol lowing (Bod, 2003))",[77],But Goodman shows that with his PCFG-reduction he can efficiently compute the aforementioned maximum constituents parse.,Method_Citation
9,E03-1005,"Bod, 2003",14,P05-1022,0,0,"This result is only slightly higher than the highest reported result for this test-set, Bod? s (.907) (Bod,2003)",[94],This paper presents the first published results with this estimator on the WSJ.,Method_Citation
10,E03-1005,2003,16,P07-1051,0,0,"This assumption is in consonance with the principle of simplicity, but there are also empirical reasons for the shortest derivation assumption: in Bod (2003) and Hearne and Way (2006), it is shown that DOP models that select the preferred parse of a test sentence using the shortest derivation criterion perform very well",[74],Goodman's main theorem is that this construction produces PCFG derivations isomorphic to DOP derivations with equal probability.,Method_Citation
11,E03-1005,"Bod, 2003",17,P07-1051,0,0,"But equally important is the fact that this new DOP* model does not suffer from a decrease in parse accuracy if larger subtrees are included, whereas the original DOP model needs to be redressed by a correction factor to maintain this property (Bod 2003)",[31],This resulted in a statistically consistent model dubbed ML-DOP.,Method_Citation
12,E03-1005,2003,18,P07-1051,0,0,"Of course, it is well-known that a supervised parser? s f-score decreases if it is transferred to another domain: for example, the (non-binarized) WSJ-trained DOP model in Bod (2003) decreases from around 91% to 85.5% f score if tested on the Brown corpus",[6],"To appreciate these innovations, it should be noted that the model was radically different from all other statistical parsing models at the time.",Method_Citation
13,E03-1005,"Bod, 2003",19,W04-0305,0,0,"A moderately larger vocabulary version (4215 tag-word pairs) of this parser achieves 89.8% F-measure on section 0, where the best current result on the testing set is 90.7% (Bod, 2003)",[94],This paper presents the first published results with this estimator on the WSJ.,Method_Citation
