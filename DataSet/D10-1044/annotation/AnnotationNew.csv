Also, we independently perform perplexity minimization for all four features of the standard SMTtranslation model: the phrase translation probabilities p (t|s) and p (s|t), and the lexical weights lex (t|s) and lex (s|t)",[40],"We focus here instead on adapting the two most important features: the language model (LM), which estimates the probability p(wIh) of a target word w following an ngram h; and the translation models (TM) p(slt) and p(t1s), which give the probability of source phrase s translating to target phrase t, and vice versa.",Method_Citation
