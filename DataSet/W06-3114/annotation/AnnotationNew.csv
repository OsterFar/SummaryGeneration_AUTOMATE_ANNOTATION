2,W06-3114,"Koehn and Monz, 2006",3,C08-1074,0,0,"For our training and test data we used the English-French subset of the Europarl corpus provided for the shared task (Koehn and Monz, 2006) at the Statistical Machine Translation workshop held in conjunction with the 2006 HLT-NAACL conference",[47],"Because of this, we retokenized and lowercased submitted output with our own tokenizer, which was also used to prepare the training and test data.",Method_Citation
3,W06-3114,"Koehn and Monz, 2006",4,W07-0718,0,0,"The results of last year? s workshop further suggested that Bleu systematically underestimated the quality of rule-based machine translation systems (Koehn and Monz, 2006)",[90],"Another way to view the judgements is that they are less quality judgements of machine translation systems per se, but rankings of machine translation systems.",Method_Citation
4,W06-3114,"Koehn and Monz, 2006",5,P07-1083,0,0,"For the bi text-based annotation, we use publicly available word alignments from the Europarl corpus, automatically generated by GIZA++ for FrenchEnglish (Fr), Spanish-English (Es) and GermanEnglish (De) (Koehn and Monz, 2006)",[49],"Hence, we use the bootstrap resampling method described by Koehn (2004).",Method_Citation
5,W06-3114,2006,6,W07-0738,0,0,"Evaluation results recently reported by Callison-Burch et al (2006) and Koehn and Monz (2006), revealed that, in certain cases, the BLEU metric may not be a reliable MTquality indicator",[140],We confirm the finding by Callison-Burch et al. (2006) that the rule-based system of Systran is not adequately appreciated by BLEU.,Method_Citation
6,W06-3114,2006,7,W07-0738,0,0,"For instance, Callison-Burch et al (2006) and Koehn and Monz (2006) reported and analyzed several cases of strong disagreement between system rankings provided by human assessors and those produced by the BLEU metric (Papineni et al, 2001)",[140],We confirm the finding by Callison-Burch et al. (2006) that the rule-based system of Systran is not adequately appreciated by BLEU.,Method_Citation
7,W06-3114,2006,8,W07-0738,0,0,Wepresenta comparative study on the behavior of several metric representatives from each linguistic level in the context of some of the cases reported by Koehn and Monz (2006) and Callison-Burch et al (2006) (see Section 3),[140],We confirm the finding by Callison-Burch et al.

9,W06-3114,"Koehn and Monz, 2006",10,D07-1030,0,0,"We use the same method described in (Koehn and Monz, 2006) to perform the significance test",[49],"Hence, we use the bootstrap resampling method described by Koehn (2004).",Method_Citation
10,W06-3114,"Koehn and Monz, 2016",11,D07-1030,0,0,"We also manually evaluated the RBMT systems and SMT systems in terms of both adequacy and fluency as defined in (Koehn and Monz, 2006)",[123],"For the manual scoring, we can distinguish only half of the systems, both in terms of fluency and adequacy.",Method_Citation
11,W06-3114,"Koehn and Monz, 2017",12,W08-0406,0,0,"The baseline is the PSMT system used for the 2006 NAACL SMT workshop (Koehn and Monz, 2006) with phrase length 3 and a trigram language model (Stolcke, 2002)",[11],"To lower the barrier of entrance to the competition, we provided a complete baseline MT system, along with data resources.",Method_Citation

13,W06-3114,"Koehn and Monz, 2006",14,D07-1091,0,0,"The English? German systems were trained on the full 751,088 sentence Europarl corpus and evaluated on the WMT 2006 test set (Koehn and Monz, 2006)",[79],Sentences and systems were randomly selected and randomly shuffled for presentation.,Method_Citation
14,W06-3114,"Koehn and Monz, 2006",15,D07-1091,0,0,"We report results on the development test set, which is also the out-of-domain test set of the WMT06 workshop shared task (Koehn and Monz, 2006)",[18],"In addition to the Europarl test set, we also collected 29 editorials from the Project Syndicate website2, which are published in all the four languages of the shared task.",Method_Citation

16,W06-3114,"Koehn and Monz, 2006",18,E12-3010,0,0,"For the same reason, human evaluation metrics based on adequacy and fluency were not suitable either (Koehn and Monz, 2006)",[156],"Almost all annotators reported difficulties in maintaining a consistent standard for fluency and adequacy judgements, but nevertheless most did not explicitly move towards a ranking-based evaluation.",Method_Citation
17,W06-3114,"Koehn and Monz, 2006",19,W09-0402,0,0,"The correlations on the document level were computed on the English, French, Spanish and German texts generated by various translation systems in the framework of the first (Koehn and Monz, 2006), second (Callison-Burch et al, 2007) and third shared translation task (Callison-Burchet al, 2008)",[33],"While building a machine translation system is a serious undertaking, in future we hope to attract more newcomers to the field by keeping the barrier of entry as low as possible.",Method_Citation
